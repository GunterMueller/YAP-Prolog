=================================================================

This folder contains objects, categories, and protocols that implement
predicates for dealing with common Prolog types and structures.

To load all a group of objects, protocols and categories in this 
library consult the corresponding *.loader utility file.

Some files represent work in progress and are not loaded by default by 
any loader utility file.

Specific notes about each group of objects, categories, and protocols 
can be found in the corresponding *.notes files.

Some of the code in this library is based on public domain Prolog code, 
in particular, adopted from the Edinburgh Prolog library.

All source files are formatted using four-spaces tabs.
