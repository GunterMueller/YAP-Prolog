- Refactor sum out in factor
- Add a way to sum out several vars at the same time
- Receive ranges as a constant reference in Indexer
- Merge TinySet and SortedVector classes
- Check if evidence remains in the compressed factor graph
- Check is this doesn't happen phi(smokes(p1),smokes(p1))
- Handle {p(X),q(X)} * {p(X),q(Y)}, X={x_1,...,x_n}, Y={x_1,...,x_n}
- Handle {p(X),p(Y)}, where constraint = (x1,x2),(x2,x1)
- Add a constant for the maximum factor size
- Add a lifted multiply operation to FoveSolver
- Maybe directly hashs instead of vectors of colors to calculate the groups in
  counting bp
