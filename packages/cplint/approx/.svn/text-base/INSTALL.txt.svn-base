To use the algorithms, you have to compile simplecudd for LPADs in folder
simplecuddLPADs. Modify the makefile provided to suit your machine and run
make, make install. Please note that glu is a library that includes cudd and
that is distributed with vis http://vlsi.colorado.edu/~vis/.
Instead of linking with libglu.a, you can link with libcudd-ver.a.
