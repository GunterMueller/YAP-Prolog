The *.preds files each contain the set of true predicates for the associated area of CS.
A predicate looks like: 

Pred( param:clsid, ... ) 

param is a constant, and clsid is the type of that constant (Person, Course, etc). The file
classtypes.txt gives the mapping from class type to clsid

If you use this data, we appreciate if you could reference our work on MLNs.
