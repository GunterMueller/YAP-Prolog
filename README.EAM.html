                   BEAM How-to-get-started

This document gives you an introduction on how to use the EAM withing YAP. 
We start by explaining how to prepare YAP to use the EAM.
Then we present some code examples that you can use to try 
out the EAM.


WARNING:
THE BEAM WITHING YAP IS STILL IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT, 
SO DON'T EXPECT IT TO RUN SMOOTHLY... 
WE ARE WORKING TO IMPROVE THE INTEGRATION OF BEAM WITHIN
YAP, BUT THIS THINGS TAKE TIME. SO PLEASE BE PATIENT...


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Compiling Yap to support the EAM.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you want to use the BEAM prototype you must compile YAP using the 
flag --enable-eam 

tar -xvzf yapfile.tar.gz           <- will extract yap to $YAPDIR
mkdir tmp                          
cd tmp
../YAPDIR/configure --enable-eam   <- prepare yap to compilation
make                               <- compile yap
su                                 <- enter as root
make install                       <- install yap

You are now ready to try YAP-BEAM. Just run "yap" on the
command line. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Quick start + Examples...
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Quick example on how to run a Prolog program using the EAM.

First you must enable the EAM using the comand 
?- eam.
yes

then you should load your program, and make your queries 
using ?- eam(query).
You can write the query normally as in normal Prolog mode, but
in this case you will only receive the first solution (or yes or no).


Small example:
Supose that you have the file Example.pl with the Prolog code:
f(1).
f(2).
f(3).

Here is an execution example:
[user]$ ./yap
% Restoring file /.../startup
YAP version Yap-5.0.0
   ?- eam.
yes
   ?- [t].
 % consulting /.../t.pl...
 % consulted /.../t.pl in module user, 1 msec 1328 bytes
yes
   ?- eam(f(X)).
[ EAM execution started to solve f/1 ]
X = 1 ? ;
X = 2 ? ;
X = 3 ? ;
no
   ?- f(X).
[ EAM execution started to solve f/1 ]
X = 1 ? ;
no
   ?-

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
A bigger example:

You can try out the next example, the well-known benchmark scanner.pl
that behaves badly in standard Prolog systems.
Just run the demos... (demo1, demo2, demo3 or demo4).
Remember to enable the EAM before loading the program.
After running the examples, try restarting YAP and 
loading the program without the EAM enabled. Try to run
the demo4... :)

3. Some notes...
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

- BEAM create the indexing code (try, retry and trust) only
considering the first argument and only when the predicates are first called.
So the first time you run a query there can be a slowdown, because the
EAM is indexing the code.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
- A lot of builtins/code are not yet supported...
For example var(X), not , ; (or), ... 
You will have a internal compiler error for these cases. 
and the clause that uses the builtin/code not supported  will always fail.
Example: consider the code:
  tst(X):- var(X), X=1.
  tst(2).

You will receive a warning that there is unsupported code.
Although you can still use the tst predicate, the first alternative
will always fail...

  ?- tst(X).
[ EAM execution started to solve tst/1 ]
X = 2 ? ;
no


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
- The EAM prefers deterministic instead of non-deterministic.
and thus can change the order of goals of your code to delay
non-deterministic bindings.

So, you must be careful when using builtins that have side-effects,
or that may expect variables to be bound.

For example, supose that you have  the following Prolog code:
f(1). 
f(2).

tst(Y):- f(X), Y is X+1.

Normal prolog would be fine, but the EAM can not execute this
code correctly because since f(X) is non-deterministic, 
Y is X+1 is executed before X being bound. The result would be:

?- tst(X).
[ EAM execution started to solve tst/1 ]
% INSTANTIATION ERROR- in arithmetic at user:tst/1 (clause 1): expected bound value


The solution for this case is to force the EAM to wait for X to be bound.

So the code correct code would be:
tst(Y):- f(X), skip_while_var(X), Y is X+1.

That means that the code Y is X+1 should be skipped 
while X is var. Note that in this case there is no more
after Y is X+1. If there were, execution would continue
on that code. 

Another alternative is to use:
tst(Y):- f(X), wait_while_var(X), Y is X+1.

that means what execution can not proceed while X is not bound.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

- To support the EAM within the YAP the WAM compilation was 
specially the classification of permanent variables.
This code was adapted from the initial BEAM implementation and is not
yet completed. 
I've have already discover some code examples where the variables
should are not being classified as permanent, and as result the BEAM
returns false solutions. We are also working on this problem...
